# Interactive Tool Explorer

I'll create a comprehensive, interactive walkthrough for the tool at: $1

## Exploration Strategy

1. **Discover Resources**
   - Fetch documentation from the provided URL
   - Find official repository, API docs, and guides
   - Identify the tool type (library, CLI, web-based)

2. **Analyze Capabilities**
   - Core features and main use cases
   - Installation/setup requirements
   - Key APIs, commands, or interfaces
   - Integration patterns

3. **Create Interactive Walkthrough**

   **For Code Libraries:**
   - Write example programs demonstrating key features
   - Show common patterns and best practices
   - Explain output and behavior
   - Save examples as runnable files

   **For CLI Tools:**
   - Installation commands for your platform
   - Essential command examples with explanations
   - Common workflows and flags
   - Actually run examples where safe

   **For Web-Based Tools:**
   - Feature tour with descriptions
   - Common workflows and use cases
   - Integration options (APIs, SDKs)
   - Tips for effective usage

4. **Provide Learning Path**
   - Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced progression
   - Key concepts to understand
   - Additional resources and references

## Your Mission

Start exploring! Be thorough, create practical examples, and make the complex simple. For a senior engineer like yourself, focus on architectural insights, integration patterns, and advanced capabilities while ensuring examples are immediately actionable.
